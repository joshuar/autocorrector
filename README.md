## ‚ùì What is it?

Autocorrector is a tool similar to Autokey or AutoHotKey, but targeted mainly at word replacements.  I wrote it because all I wanted to do was fix my fat-finger typos automatically.  That is what autocorrector aims to do.  

Autocorrector reads a TOML configuration file of key-values; the key being the typo and the value being the replacement.  When it detects you have entered a typo, it helpfully corrects it.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

> **Note**
> **This program will only run on Linux**

1. Download either the `.rpm` or `.deb` file and install using your package manager.
2. Set up the client: `autocorrector client setup`
3. Set up the server: `sudo autocorrector enable $USERNAME` (substitute `$USERNAME` for your username)
4. Start the service with `systemctl start autocorrector@USERNAME`.
5. Run `autocorrector client` or use the **autocorrector** menu entry in your desktop environment.

The following Go libraries and tools made autocorrector infinitely easier:

- [gokbd](https://github.com/joshuar/gokbd): library using libevdev to talk to a keyboard on Linux. It allows snooping the keys pressed as well as typing out keys.
- [fyne](https://fyne.io/): UI toolkit and system tray library.
- [zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog): logging library.
- [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper): configuration file handling.
- [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra): command-line interface.
- [nutsdb](https://xujiajun.cn/nutsdb/): simple, fast, embeddable and persistent key/value store written in pure Go.
